This Python program uses the pydub library to manipulate and play audio files. Here’s what each part of the code does:

Load the audio files: The program starts by loading two audio files, “audio1.wav” and “audio2.wav”. These files are stored in the audio and drum_beat variables, respectively.
Change voice: The program then changes the pitch of the audio in the audio variable. It does this by increasing the frame rate of the audio by 1.5 times. The result is a high-pitched version of the original audio, which is stored in the high_pitched_audio variable.
Change volume: Next, the program increases the volume of the original audio by 10 decibels (dB). This makes the audio louder. The louder audio is stored in the louder_audio variable.
Loop: The program then creates a looped version of the original audio. It does this by repeating the audio 3 times. The looped audio is stored in the looped_audio variable.
Overlap: The program then creates an overlapped version of the original audio. It does this by playing the original audio and the drum beat audio at the same time. The overlapped audio is stored in the overlapped_audio variable.
Play each modified audio segment: Finally, the program plays each of the modified audio segments: the high-pitched audio, the louder audio, the looped audio, and the overlapped audio.
